# Autonomous Luggage Cart README

## Overview
The Autonomous Luggage Cart is an innovative solution designed to follow its owner while avoiding obstacles, leveraging GPS for navigation and an ultrasonic sensing system for immediate surroundings. This README outlines the setup, usage, and customization of the luggage cart software.

## Features
- **GPS Tracking**: Utilizes GPS data to follow a specified path or head towards a given set of coordinates.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Employs ultrasonic sensors to detect and navigate around obstacles.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Allows for remote control and path updates via a Bluetooth-connected smartphone.
- **Compass Integration**: Utilizes a digital compass to maintain direction and bearing.

## Hardware Requirements
- Microcontroller (Arduino or compatible)
- GPS Module
- HMC5883L Digital Compass
- HC-05 or HC-06 Bluetooth Module
- Ultrasonic Sensors (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Motor Driver (compatible with your motor specifications)
- DC Motors (with wheels)
- Battery (capacity depending on your requirements)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE or any compatible development environment
- Relevant libraries for GPS, HMC5883L, HC-05/HC-06, and ultrasonic sensors

## Setup Guide
1. **Assemble Hardware**: Connect the GPS module, digital compass, Bluetooth module, ultrasonic sensors, motor driver, and motors to the microcontroller according to their datasheets.
2. **Install Libraries**: In your Arduino IDE, go to the Library Manager and install libraries for the GPS module, HMC5883L, Bluetooth module, and ultrasonic sensors.
3. **Load Software**: Download the Autonomous Luggage Cart software from the repository and open it in your Arduino IDE.
4. **Configuration**: Adjust the software settings to match your hardware setup, such as pin assignments and sensor thresholds.
5. **Upload Code**: Connect your microcontroller to your computer and upload the Autonomous Luggage Cart software.

## Usage
- Power on the luggage cart and ensure the GPS has a clear sky view for initial positioning.
- Connect your smartphone to the luggage cart's Bluetooth module for remote control and monitoring.
- Use the designated app or commands to set your desired destination or to manually control the cart.

## Customization
- **Path Planning**: Implement or modify path planning algorithms to improve navigation efficiency.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Enhance obstacle detection and avoidance by integrating data from multiple sensors.
- **Power Management**: Develop power-saving features to extend battery life during operation.
- **User Interface**: Create or improve the smartphone app for a more intuitive user experience.

## Troubleshooting
- **GPS Signal**: Ensure the GPS module has a clear view of the sky. Tall buildings or dense foliage can obstruct signals.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Test and adjust the ultrasonic sensor range to optimize obstacle detection and avoidance.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Check for interference from other devices and ensure the smartphone is within range.
